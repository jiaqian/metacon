Welcome to use MetaCon (binning metagenomic contigs by composition matrix and coverage matrix)!
===================

Metacon is an easy, but effective method, it utilizes the composition and coverage matrices to compose the contigs feature matrix. In addition, it normalizes the two matrices independently and then feed them into the k-medoids in order to obtain well-generated clusters in the first-stage, and finally assign the short contigs to the closest cluster centroid during the second-stage.

Matlab (version R2017b)

----------
Description
---------------
This package contains the following files.

	test_strain.m -> a demo on simulated 'strain' dataset
	permn.m -> generation of k-mers
	precision_recall_computing -> compute the precision and recall, defined in [1]
        data -> it contains the strain, species, sharon data set
        fastkmeans -> a fast method to compute k-means
        cal_number_cluster -> method to estimate the number of clusters


Please try to execute 'test_strain.m' to learn how to use this software.
***Note: this method is developed under MATLAB R2017b, and we used some built-in functions, if you have the different version, it may arouse some problems.

----------
Preprocessing
---------------

The preprocessing steps aim to extract coverage profile and sequence composition profile as input to our program, which can be tackled by CONCOCT [2], you can find all the details there.
